I am a research scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My current research focuses on **traffic safety, deep learning, big data, connected vehicles, and traffic simulation**. My CV is available from [here](https://peili-sandman.github.io/files/cv_pei.pdf).


<!---
I received my PhD degree in Transportation Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Aty](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/aty/). I received my master degree in communication and transportation engineering and bachelor degree in logistics engineering from Tongji University in 2015 and 2018, respectively.
