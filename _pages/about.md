I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://umtri.umich.edu/people/pei-li/) at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ([UMTRI](https://umtri.umich.edu/people/pei-li/)). Prior to joining UMTRI, I received my PhD degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Central Florida in 2021. I received my master degree in communication and transportation engineering and bachelor degree in logistics engineering from Tongji University in 2015 and 2018, respectively. 

My current research focuses on **traffic safety, deep learning, big data, connected vehicles, and traffic simulation**. My CV is available from [here](https://peili-sandman.github.io/files/cv_pei.pdf).
