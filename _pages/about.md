I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil Engineering at University of Central Florida (UCF), advised by Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Aty. I also work as a research assistant in Smart & Safe Transportation Lab [(UCF-SST)](http://smartsafesst.com/index.html) at UCF. I received my MS degree in Civil Engineering (Smart Cities) from UCF, 2020. Prior to joining UCF, I received my master degree in communication and transportation engineering and bachelor degree in logistics engineering from Tongji University in 2015 and 2018, respectively. 

My current research focuses on **traffic safety, deep learning, big data, connected vehicles, and sensors**. My CV is available from [here](https://peili-sandman.github.io/files/cv_pei.pdf).
